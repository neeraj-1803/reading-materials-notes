	a>b => all b which is immediatedly under it(children of a) will be selected
	a[] =>any attribute can be used under the brackets to specify the style property, can be used as conditional property to change styles.
	a:attr => these are pseudo selectors, and any properties can be included here such as hover, click, etc.

<meta name = "viewport" content = "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> => to make the viewport be optimized according to device width and not shrink the page on a smaller device.
@media (min-width: 600px){
	//apply whatever style you want under this, this will be for anything i.e., 600px and above.
}

.row {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}
